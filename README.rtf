WELCOME TO THE UNDERWORLD FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP


For my Open Classrooms project, I have creating this simple game that can only be played on the Xcode terminal.


This is a fighting game using a RPG loop style.

The project asked bonus to insert is a general game statistics that trigger at the end of the fight. Using simple variables incrementation each time an action is turned on.
