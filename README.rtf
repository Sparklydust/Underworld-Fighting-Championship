UNDERWORLD FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP


WELCOME TO THE UNDERWORLD FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP

This is a fighting game using a RPG fight style.

The asked bonus insert in game is a general game statistics that trigger at the end of the fight. Using simple variables incrementation each time an action is turned on.
